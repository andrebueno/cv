          I am working on the development team of an integrated geo-mechanical
          analysis system for studies on the genesis and mechanical development of
          geological structures at Tecgraf Institute.
          <br><br>
          I am happy to announce my personal project:
          "BandejApp", an Android app that shows the daily menu of the PUC-Rio's
          popular restaurant called "Bandejão".
          <br><br>
          During my Masters I developed a methodology for Multi GPU programming
          using OpenCL technology that resulted in an article published in April 2017
          on the journal Engineering Computations.
          <br><br>
          During my Doctorate I created a methodology to evaluate the feasibility of
          joining the relaxed synchronization technique with supervised learning
          methods in order to obtain a final system that adapts to any triple
          input/application/execution environment.
          My work resulted in an article published in May 2020 on the journal
          Future Generation Computer Systems.
